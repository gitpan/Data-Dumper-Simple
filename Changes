Revision history for Perl extension Data::Dumper::Simple.

0.01  Fri Jul 30 16:29:14 PDT 2004
	- original version; created by make_project 0.1

0.02  Sat Jul 31 12:30:00 PDT 2004
    - fixed tiny bug with how scalars were represented when
      a reference to one is taken.

0.03  Sat Jul 31 15:30:00 PDT 2004
    - Changed the filter from "code" to "executable".  This
      will sometimes mean that quoted data could be inappropriately
      interpolated, but there appears to be an obscure bug in 
      Filter::Simple.  Still, this is a debugging module and it
      should not really be an issue.
